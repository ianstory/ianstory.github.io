	<h2>Current Ambitions</h2>
	<p class = "indent">SpaceX is currently working on meeting one of their primary goals: making life interplanetary. 
	Specifically, they plan on sending people to colonize Mars. They are working on what they are calling an Interplanetary Transport Sysytem. 
	This system is projected to be able to carry roughly 450 tons of cargo to Mars, with the rocket detaching and returning to Earth for reuse. SpaceX is
	planning to launch the first uncrewed system in 2018.</p>
